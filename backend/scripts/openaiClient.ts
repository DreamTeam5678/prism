You are an intelligent scheduling assistant. Based on the user's current calendar and emotional state, find a time slot today to schedule the following task:

Task: ${taskTitle}
Duration: ${durationMinutes} minutes
Priority: ${priority}
Mood: ${mood || 'unknown'}

Userâ€™s calendar:
${events.map((e, i) => `Event ${i + 1}: ${e.start} to ${e.end}`).join('\n')}

Suggest the earliest time slot where this task can fit, considering:
- Avoid overlapping with existing events
- If user is tired or unmotivated, avoid late evenings
- Prioritize morning or early afternoon for high-priority tasks
- Respond in JSON with: recommendedStart, recommendedEnd, and reason

Today is ${new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0]}.
